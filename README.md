  remnants: kind acts of cruetly 
</h1>

kindactsofcruelty.com is an educational webiste about microaggressions, helping to understand why certain phrases might be problematic, what effects microaggressions cause, and how to act when they happen.

In times that are determined by turbulence, racial unrests, uprisings, and emergent movements that are striving for equality and the abolishment of racial injustice, we have to create a space of understanding where those who are marginalized not only have a voice, but are also heard by those in the position of power. The initial step for this space to be created is tied with the creation of awareness, which means that those with privilege need to understand the trauma that results from racism and that BIPoC are going through on a daily basis. 

The idea that racism only exists when it appears in its most radical form – whether it be in physical violence or right-wing rhetoric – starts to crack and more and more people realize that racism appears in a myriad of ways, of which most are subtle, almost not perceivable (at least for those with privilege). There is a name for this kind of racism and it is called Microaggression. The project revolves around the idea of trying to make Microaggressions visible for the ones who are not affected by it and the aim is to create awareness for the concerns and issues of the people who are left unheard and invisible.
