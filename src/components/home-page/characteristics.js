            Microaggressions appear in a myriad of ways, they can be examined
            across many different dimensions of diversity, whether it be gender,
            sexuality, race, ethnicity, age, disability, and religion.
            <br />
            But there are common traits or hidden messages that are being
            transported by the sender of the microaggressions:
          </p>
          <p>
            Microaggressions often happen when people are trying to be good
            people.
          </p>
          <p>
            They slip out when people have good intentions, trying to
            complement, be curious, show comfort, be funny.
            <br />
            One of the reasons that microaggressions are expressed even though
            the speakerâ€™s intention might be a good or benign one, is, that we
            all have unconscious (or implicit) biases
